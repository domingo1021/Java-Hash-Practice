<h3>Practice Hash in Java </h3>

Mainly refer to `Java documentations` and build Hash object.

1. [Hashtable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html)
2. [HashMap](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html)

Note:  
1. `HashTable` is thread-safe and can be used in **multi-thread** Java application, and slower then `HashMap`
2. `HashMap` is no thread-safe. And it allows null key and value.
